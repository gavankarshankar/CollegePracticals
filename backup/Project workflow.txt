In today's digital world, it's crucial for college to communicate well with students and parents. 
The 'Admission Enquiry System' helps by using Python and Pywhatkit to send updates through WhatsApp and SMS.
This means students and parents get important information like admission dates and merit list updates directly on their phones. 
They don't have to keep visiting (or keep calling to HOD or teachers) the college in person all the time. 
This makes the whole process easier and more convenient for everyone involved.
